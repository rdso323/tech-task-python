ASSUMPTIONS
- If the number of count days for the first week (countsForFirstWeek) meets the "requiredDays" number, the startdate is the first day of the first week
- If the "requiredDays" number isn't met, return the minimum date possible with a count of 0.
- Start date can only occur in week of the first date, or one week after

DONE
- Changed naming convention from camelCase to underscore for variable and params
- Created a variable for the duration of a week to be used 
- Rewrote the count statements to make it more readable
- Initialised counts prior to if statement
- Removed "requiredNumberInFirstWeek" as it's an unncessary variable
- Added planned start for first week as option
- To test if planned start in first week
- Test if dates occured after second week
- Test if required days not met
- Added test for "count" for "test_empty"
- In this scenario, no mock is required as there aren't any external dependencies to account for

NEED TO DO

EXTRA NOTES
- Left in commented out code to use for comparison in demo
